### Information about The Application

This application is **NOT FINISHED** yet (at the moment), because of the prerequisites that needs to be done in Android application, hence this specific branch of the IWSS repository will be used for Desktop development mode via Kivy library in Python. There are some of the Android build-type of codes inside the code and it will be removed in the future updates (but still runnable in Windows specifically).

### Application Requirements

```cmd
pip install kivy numpy pillow
```
